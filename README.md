# Expense Reimbursement System (ERS)
A reimbursement system created for a faux company. Employees can log in, view their reimbursement requests, and submit new requests. Finance managers can log in, view reimbursement requests from ALL employees, and accept or deny them. Information on user accounts and reimbursements is stored in a GCP Postgres database and the system's server is deployed using Javalin.
